# Mathcraft

Hello! and welcome to Mathcraft. An immersive aproach to visualizing the world of mathematics.

This is a graphing calulator inspired by tools like desmos geogebra and solidworks.

You can find the live website [here](https://arnavmk.github.io/Mathcraft/)

There is an introductory video and a user manual in the main page (link above). or you could go ---> Mathcraft/Video/Video.mp4 and Mathcraft/User Manual/manual.pdf

All the features are explained in the manual and showcased in the video.

Main branch: This is the production branch which is used by the live website. This is the most stable version of mathcraft

Dev branch: This is where I make and test new fetures before merging to main, if you still wish to look at the latest version clone this branch.

To run this project via the source code. Use the live server extension either in vscode or the npm package. (npm install live-server). But you can always visit the live website [here](https://arnavmk.github.io/Mathcraft/)

Here are some cool graphs you can plot in mathcraft.

sin(x^2) + tan(x) ---> differentiate ---> edit derivative ---> whole divide by 8 (or any number) ---> select and mirror along x

# Mathcraft

Hello! and welcome to Mathcraft. An immersive aproach to visualizing the world of mathematics.

This is a graphing calulator inspired by tools like desmos geogebra and solidworks.

You can find the live website ![here](https://arnavmk.github.io/Mathcraft/)

There is an introductory video and a user manual in the main page (link above). or you could go ---> Mathcraft/Video/Video.mp4 and Mathcraft/User Manual/manual.pdf

All the features are explained in the manual and showcased in the video.

Here are some cool graphs you can plot in mathcraft.

sin(x^2) + tan(x) ---> differentiate ---> edit derivative ---> whole divide by 8 (or any number) ---> select and mirror along x
